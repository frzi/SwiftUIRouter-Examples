# TabView example
> Combining *SwiftUI Router* and TabViews.

[SwiftUI Router](https://github.com/frzi/SwiftUIRouter) does not work with SwiftUI's `TabView`s (and `List`s) out of the box, as they both use different forms of states. This sample project demonstrates how, with a little bit of extra code, you can combine both paradigms.
